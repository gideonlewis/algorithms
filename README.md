# Golang Data structures & Algorithms
This is a repository on GitHub that I put a lot of effort into, focusing on data structures and algorithms that I have learned from many different sources and summarized from a personal perspective. The repository provides example source code in Golang and programming exercises for users to practice and improve their programming skills and deepen their understanding of the fundamental concepts in the field. The source code and exercises are arranged according to specific topics and have detailed instructions to help users easily learn and apply in their projects.

## Data structures
**Data structure** is a form of organizing and storing data in a systematic and orderly manner so that it can be used in the most efficient and optimal way. Includes data values, relationships, and functions and operations that can be applied to data. <i>Characteristics of a Data Structure </i>:
- Accuracy
- Time complexity
- Space complexity

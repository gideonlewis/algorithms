# data-structures-and-algorithms
<p>My project is a repository on GitHub focused on data structures and algorithms implemented using the Go programming language. The repository provides example source code and programming exercises for users to practice and enhance their programming skills and gain a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts in this field. The source code and exercises are organized by specific topics and include detailed instructions to make it easy for users to learn and apply to their own projects.</p>

<h2>1. Algorithmic complexity (big O)</h2>
<h2>2. Sort & Binary search</h2>
<h2>3. Recursion & Backtracking</h2>
<h2>4. Data structure Stack, Queue, Dequeue</h2>

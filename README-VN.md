# Data Structures & Algorithms
This is a repository on GitHub focused on data structures and algorithms implemented using the Go programming language. The repository provides example source code and programming exercises for users to practice and enhance their programming skills and gain a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts in this field. The source code and exercises are organized by specific topics and include detailed instructions to make it easy for users to learn and apply to their own projects.

## Data Structures
### 1. Array
Array is divided into 2 main types by properties:

- **Statis Array**: array has a fixed size when declared and cannot be changed during runtime, when creating it needs to determine the appropriate number of elements.

- **Dynamic Array**: array is resizable at runtime, when there is not enough space to add new elements it resizes itself accordingly.

There are two common types of Array by structure (dimension):
- **One-dimensional Array**: is a linear data structure where the elements are arranged in a single row or column, each element is marked and accessed by index.

- **Two-dimensional Array**: is a table data structure consisting of rows and columns, each element in the array is accessed by 2 indexes, one of the row index and one of the column index.

Each element in an array can be a number, string, object, ...

### 2. Linked List
There are 3 common types of linked lists:
-**Singly Linked List**:
-**Doubly Linked List**:
-**Circular Linked List**:

### 3. Stack
### 4. Queue
### 5. Tree
### 6. Graph
